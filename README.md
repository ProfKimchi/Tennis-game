# Tennis!
A two player tennis game created for use in the UCFK4. Created by Kendrick Dela Cruz and Tio Sasanuma Howard.

## Running the game
It is compiled and loaded onto the fun kit by running
```bash
make program
```

## Play guide
When the game is loaded "PRESS TO START" will be displayed. 
Both players must push the nav switch to go into the starting player selection screen.
Privately select paper, scissors or rock by pressing North/South on the nav switch, and pushing to select.
Align the IR communications, and press the nav switch again to transmit your selection. 
The winner will then be able to select the starting direction for their tennis ball, and must push the nav switch to send the ball.
Both players can move their racket with the North/South toggle on the nav switch.
When the ball hits the back edge, that player loses, and can restart with possession of the ball.

To reset the entire game, use the make program command once more.
